Methane is a stronger greenhouse gas than the others because it has much higher heat trapping ability. Methane on a weight basis has 21 times the global warming potential (GWP) of carbon dioxide. Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas, and oil. Methane emissions also result from livestock and other agricultural practices and by the decay of organic waste in municipal solid waste landfills.
