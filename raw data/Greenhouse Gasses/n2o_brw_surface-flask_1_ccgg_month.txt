# comment:  
# comment: These data are made freely available to the public and the
# comment: scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination
# comment: will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.
# comment: The availability of these data does not constitute publication
# comment: of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to
# comment: ensure that GML receives fair credit for their work.  If the data
